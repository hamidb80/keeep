      Notes from Uiua programming language ↯◰⍥
    </h1>

    <p>
      This week I've tried <a href="https://www.uiua.org/">Uiua</a>,
      a very strange programming language. How strange? Well I'm glad you've asked. It is
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>functional (i.e. mutations are not allowed)</li>
      <li>array based</li>
      <li>heavily relied on combinators</li>
      <li>dynamicly typed</li>
      <li>stack based [advocates tacit programming, meaning your arguments do not have
        name, only order matters]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      you can say it is successor to APL, a very strange programming language that looks
      anything but <u>A</u> <u>P</u>rogramming <u>L</u>anguage [, hence the name].

      see
      <a href="https://github.com/codereport/array-language-comparisons">
        Array languages comparisons
      </a>
      for more info.
    </p>

    <p>
      if I want to present a little about its weirdness, just take a look at Uiua solution for
      <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/100_doors">
        100 doors problem on Rosetta Code
      </a>
      :
    </p>

    <pre><code block lang="python" highlight>
      ◿2/+=0⊞◿.+1⇡100
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Let's write it line by line for better illustration
      <footnote>
        the cool thing about the interpreter is if you put empty double comment
        <code>##</code>,
        after running your script, it will be replaced with the latest value on the stack
        (
        actually you dont need to manually run it,
        you just hit uiua command and it will start to watch your <code>.ua</code> files
        ).
      </footnote>
      . this is line separated version of above code. (<i>I've replaced 100 with 10 for simplicity</i>)
    </p>

    <pre><code block lang="python" highlight>
      ⇡10
      #- creates a range from 0 to 10-1
      ## [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

      +1
      #- add 1 to all of them
      ## [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]

      .
      #- makes a copy of this array on the stack [actually not a copy, just a reference]
      ## [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]

      ⊞◿
      #- creates a 2D array with each row modulated by column. ◿ is modulo function.

    <p>
      The resulting array indicates which doors are open(1) and which ones are closed(0).

    <p>
      My motivation to learn Uiua was mostly <b>Curiosity</b>,
      I really wanted to know what is the secret behind this cryptic texts!
      The curiosity is activated after reading
      <a href="https://citizen428.net/blog/exploring-uiua/">exploring Uiua</a>, big thank to its author.
    </p>

    <h6>The Shiny Side</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Looks</b> - the code seems pretty even though unreadable, its online editor and VS Code extension colors
        functions and combinators based on their arity (number of arguemtns) e.g. functions with 1 argument are green,
        functions with 2 arguments are blue, ...)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Syntax</b> - sorry this can be counted as looks, but isn't it amazing to write a function name and get its
        glyph by the formatter? you just have to remember its name!
        It reminds me Pinyin for <i>Chinese</i>
        <footnote>
          the language that I love but can't find time to learn it
        </footnote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Documentation</b> - in some sections after explaining the idea behind concept,
        it had exercises with ability to run directly in the browser
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h6>The Ugly Side</h6>
    <p>
      Life is about trade-off.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        I found the <i>tacit programming style</i>
        actually a very good technique when your function is small and does something simple;
        But as purpose of the function gets more complex, you may feel drowning in your code.
        Although I'd say the author has done a remarkable job to reduce this complexity by ideas

        like <kbd>Planet Notation <code>⋅⊙⋅∘</code></kbd> (for stack manipulation)
        or modifiers like <kbd>Both <code>∩</code></kbd> (for applying 1 function to 2 sets of values)
        and <kbd>Fork <code>⊃</code></kbd> (for applying multiple functions on same set of values).
      </li>
      <li>
        The choice of using <kbd>Box <code>□</code></kbd> as a wrapper for array cells
        with dynamic typing behaviour of the language really hurts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conditional primitives are not mature yet and using them is not convenient.
        I can't imagine how on Earth is possible to write a program without conditionals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loop primitives is also confusing.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h6>Side Notes</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I really liked their <a href="https://www.uiua.org/docs/design">defense of design</a>;
        it made me think about basic things.
      </li>
      <li>
        the choice of primitives help the language to do a
        <a href="https://www.uiua.org/docs/optimizations">novel sets of optimization</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I really liked this quote from Uiua website:
        <blockquote>
          If this code seems weird and unreadable, that's okay! It's important to remember that
          <a href="https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2018/10/31/become-perl.html">foreign ≠ confusing</a>.
        </blockquote>
        It reminds me of this quote from <i>Bernard Shaw</i>
        <blockquote>
          Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Take Aways</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>
        as I mentioned earlier, it gets <mark>exponentialy</mark> more complex when your
        problem gets more complex and your edge cases arise.
      </li>
      <li>
        as result, even simple <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> problems
        require you to spend hours and hours thinking
        <mark> array-based + stack based + functional</mark>;
        believe me It's too much.
      </li>
    </ul>
