    <h1>why do I prefer HTML over markdown?</h1>
    <p>
      I really don't understand the hype about markdown:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        It is very hard to <b>parse</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not have a lot of features built-in like <i>tables</i>, hence there are a lots of extenstions.
      </li>
      <li>
        you can't do something like setting text aligment or width of an image
      </li>
      <li>
        you can write normal HTML, but <b>why don't write HTML from scratch??</b>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The downsides mentioned above are kind of bi-directional, meaning one influences the other.
      for example, having too many extentions,
      makes markdown parser libraries more complex and a lot of them not supporting the features you may want.
      or having a wierd syntax makes it a lot harder to write a parser for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      one time I used a markdown parser happily with english and ASCII characters,
      but then I used it for another language like Arabic and it would not able to parse.
      maybe you'd argue that it is because of the programmer did not pay attention to Unicode characters;
      correct, but I say it is less likely to happen in XML or HTML parser <mark>because of its obvious syntax</mark>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is analogues to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a>
      VS Python.
      LISP has super simple syntax, hence it enables programmers pay more attention to more useful features,
      like closure functions and garbage collection, that most say first apeared in LISP;
      which was revolutionary at that time.

      So, instead of writing <code>.md</code> and then converting it to <code>.html</code>,
      I've decided to just write raw HTML, in this way, I don't need a 
      <em>super extensible markdown library with built-in support of feature 1 and feature 2</em> which I don't care at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is a 
      <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">MarkUp Language</a></em> in contrast to Mark<b>Down</b>, 
      I'll bet you haven't heard of tags such as 
      
      <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> for <i>quotation</i>
      or 
      <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>
      or even
      <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> for <i>keyboard shortcuts</i>.

      The list goes on but HTML already has lots of things you are looking for in the document format <mark>since long time ago</mark>;
      why bother yourself to write a program/library to convert a limited format into a rich format?
